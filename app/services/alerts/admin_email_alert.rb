module Alerts

  # Abstract parent class for all alerts that send out emails to admins
  #
  # Responsibility: sets the information needed so that the parent class(es) can
  #  process the condition for an email sent to Admins

  #  SUBCLASSES MUST IMPLEMENT SPECIFIC METHODS.
  #  They must be implemented to satisfy the interface for this abstract class.
  #  Any method that a subclass must implement will raise a NoMethod error
  #  here in this class unless a subclass implements it.
