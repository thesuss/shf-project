  # @desc Responsibility: Abstract class for checking to see if all requirements
  #       have been met for some class. It verifies that the arguments include _entity:_ and optionally _date:_
  #       It responds to '.satisfied?' with true (all requirements are met/satisified)
  #       or false (they are not met/satisfied)

  #
  #       Each subclass MUST define the following method:
  #        'self.requirements_met?(_args)'  does the actual checking to see
  #           if the requirements have been satisifed
  #
  #
  #  This is implemented as a Class instead of a Singleton, but either approach is valid.
