  #
  # @desc Responsibility: Knows what the membership requirements are for a User
  #       - Given a user, it can respond true or false if membership requirements are met.
  #
  #       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
  #       The importance is that
  #       IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT CODE NEEDS TO BE TOUCHED IF MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGED.
  #
  #  Only 1 is needed for the system.
