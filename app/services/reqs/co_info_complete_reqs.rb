  # @desc Responsibility: Knows when the a company has all required information
  #       a.k.a. is "complete" (= the requirements are met)
  #
  #       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
  #
  #       If the rules/definition for a 'complete' company change, this class
  #       must be changed _and_ the Company.complete scope must be changed.
  #
  #  Only 1 is needed for the system.
