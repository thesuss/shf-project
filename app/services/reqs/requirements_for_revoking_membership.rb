  # @class RequirementsForRevokingMembership
  #
  # @desc Responsibility: Knows what the requirements are for revoking membership for a User
  #       - Given a user, it can respond true or false if all requirements are met to revoke membership.
  #        Can only revoke a membership if the user is a member
  #
  #       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
  #       The importance is that
  #       IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT CODE NEEDS TO BE TOUCHED IF MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGED.
  #
  #  Only 1 is needed for the system.
  #  This is implemented as a Class instead of a Singleton, but either approach is valid.
