  # @class RequirementsForMembershipLapsed
  #
  # @desc Responsibility: Knows if a membership has lapsed
  #
  #       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
  #       The importance is that
  #        it is the only place that code needs to be touched if the rules for
  #        if a Membership has lapsed
  #
  #  Only 1 is needed for the system.
