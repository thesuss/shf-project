# UserChecklistManager
#
# @responsibility Handle all behavior and queries for a UserChecklist associated with a User. This is
#   mostly about the _membership guidelines checklist_ (and perhaps should be renamed to reflect that).
#
#   - determines if a user has agreed to the _membership guidelines checklist_
#     based on the date all were completed and the membership status.
#   - can create a new _membership guidelines checklist_ for a user if needed
#   - return the most recently completed _membership guidelines checklist_
#
# Business rule: Once a membership expires and they are in the grace period
#   they must agree to the Membership guidelines again.
#
# 2020-12-07  Business Rule: Everyone must always agree to the membership guidelines,
# no matter when their term starts/ends, etc.
# The only limiting factor is when the Membership Guidelines requirement started.
#
# @todo move this into /services folder since this is all behavior and no persistence
# @todo This definitely shows (smells!) that the User model should be refactored along the membership_status;
#   there is lots of conditional code based on the membership_status
