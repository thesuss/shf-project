#
# @desc Responsibility: track the status of a checklist item (an AdminOnly::MasterChecklist)
# for a particular User
#
# Note: If a list has sublists (children), it cannot be manually set to un-/completed.
#   The completion status is set automatically based on the children (e.g. if they are are complete or not).
#
#
# What happens when you change the master list?  does it reflect that?
#   - No:  SHF board decided that when a person renews again (or has reason to see the checklist again),
#     the users will see the new/updated/changed information from a master list.  (Otherwise we have to notify each user of the change(s) each time.)
