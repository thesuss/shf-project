# @responsibility  A user that can log in.  Knows membership _payment_ status,
#   application status.
#
#   - knows if a file was uploaded during the right timeframe based on membership status (this should be the responsibility of some other class)
#
#
# 2021-02-19: First step towards refactoring: have existing methods call MembershipsManager methods
# (a kind of manual delegation).
# @todo should any of the methods be delegated to the MembershipsManager?
#   Next steps will be to call MembershipManager methods directly where needed.
#
# @todo should 'expires_soon' be a membership status instead of just 'informational' ?
#
# @todo refactor proof of membership image stuff to separate class
#
# @todo this class has waaaay too many responsibilities
