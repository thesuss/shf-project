  #
  # @desc Responsibility: Aggregates discrete data items that are used to configure
  #  various aspects of the system (app).
  #  "configure" means settings that are more about customizing the application;
  # settings that can be changed after the application is running.
  #
  #  This is a Singleton. (Only 1 AppConfiguration instance exists/is needed.)
  #  This is enforced in the following ways:
  #    1. There is an index defined on the '' column in the table, and
  #       this index
  #       If the database detects an attempt to create more than 1 record
  #       (e.g. more than 1 index entry), it will throw a
  #       ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique exception.
  #       See the comments for validates_uniqueness_of {ActiveRecord::Validations::UniquenessValidator::ClassMethods#validates_uniqueness_of}.
  #       Specifically, read the section "Concurrency and integrity"
  #    2. validates_inclusion_of :singleton_guard, in: [0]
  #       This ensures that the value of :singleton_guard can only be 0
  #       Combined with the unique index above, this ensures that there can
  #       only be 1 row in the table, and the singleton_guard value is always 0.
