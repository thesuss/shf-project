# @class RequirementsForHBrandingFeeWillExpire
#
# @desc Responsibility: Knows when an H-Branding Fee WILL BE expiring for a company
# (= the requirements are met). This is about the upcoming expiration date
# for the H-Branding license.
#
#       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
#       The importance is that
#        it is the only place that code needs to be touched if the rules for
#        when an H-Branding fee is due are changed.
#
#  Only 1 is needed for the system.
