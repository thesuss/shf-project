# @class MembershipStatusUpdater
#
# @desc Responsibility:  Keep membership status up-to-date based the current business rules
#    and requirements.
#  - gets notifications from events in the system and does what is needed with them to
#    update the status of memberships for people in the system
#
#    This is a Singleton.  Only 1 is needed for the system.

# Only check to see if requirements have been satisfied for Renewal or Membership when:
#   * a payment is made, or
#   * a checklist is completed (e.g. 'Agree to all Ethical Guidelines' checklist)
#
# Otherwise each time the requirements for renewal or membership are checked (e.g. at login),
# the payment and non-payment requirements will be satisfied and membership or renewal will be
# incorrectly granted again.
# In other words, the only time that we _should_ check to see if membership or renewal can be granted
# is when a payment is made or a checklist is completed (e.g. 'Agree to all Ethical Guidelines' checklist)
#
#
# The Observer pattern is used to send notifications (methods) when something
# 'interesting' has changed.  When the MembershipStatusUpdater receives one of these
# notifications, it checks the membership to see if it needs to be changed (updated
# or revoked).  It does this via the :check_requirements_and_act({ user: user })
# method.  (This method is the public interface and main method for all
# Updater classes.)
#
# This check is logged with the ActivityLogger so that anything that happens is
# logged.
#
#
#   MembershipStatusUpdater has the responsibility of checking to see if the membership status
#   should be changed (updated) based on the current business rules.
#   Thus all of the business rules can be in just _one place_ (DRY).
#   Only 1 class has the responsibility for enforcing them.  No other classes have to care about them.
#
#   Satisfies the "Open/Closed" principle in SOLID:  putting the business logic
#   into 1 Observer class keeps it open to extension changes (just this class)
#   but closed to having to modify lots of code when the requirements change
