# @class RequirementsForMembershipLapsed
#
# @desc Responsibility: Knows if a membership has lapsed
#
#       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
#       The importance is that
#        it is the only place that code needs to be touched if the rules for
#        if a Membership has lapsed
#
#  Only 1 is needed for the system.
