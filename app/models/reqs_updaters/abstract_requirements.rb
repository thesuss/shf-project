# @class AbstractRequirements
#
# @desc Responsibility: Abstract class for checking to see if all requirements
#       have been met for some class.
#       It responds to '.satisfied?' with true (all requirements are met/satisified)
#       or false (they are not met/satisfied)
#
#
#       Each subclass MUST define the following methods:
#
#        'self.has_expected_arguments?(args)' verifies that the all the arguments (a Hash)
#           expected are provided so that requirements can be checked
#           Must return true or false (*not* nil) per the convention of a method that ends with "?"
#
#        'self.requirements_met?(_args)'  does the actual checking to see
#           if the requirements have been satisifed
#
#
#  This is implemented as a Class instead of a Singleton, but either approach is valid.
