# @class RequirementsForCoInfoNotComplete
#
# @desc Responsibility: Knows when the required information for a company
#       is _not_ complete
#
#       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
#       The importance is that
#        it is the only place that code needs to be touched if the rules for
#        this are changed.
#
#  Only 1 is needed for the system.
