# Common behavior for payments:
#   the most recent completed payment,
#      notes for the most recent payment,
#   start and expiration dates
#   has the term expired, is a payment due, etc.
#
# Using self.class::THIS_PAYMENT_TYPE as the default for a payment type
# means that the payment type for a Payor (e.g. the class that is using this module)
# does not have explictly pass the payment type every single time a method is called.
# Ex:  a User does not have to specify a Membership payment every time; the default
#   payment type for a User is a Membership payment, so that is used as the default
#   (unless a payment type is explicitly given, of course).
#   Likewise, the default payment type for a Company is an H-branding fee payment,
#   so when a Company uses these methods, that does not have to be specified every time.
