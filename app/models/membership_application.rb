  #  A Company for a membership application (an instantiated one)
  #  is created (instantiated) only when a membership is *accepted* --
  #  unless the company already exists, in which case that existing instance
  #  is associated with a membership application.
  #  See the 'accept_membership' method below; note the .find_or_create method
  #
  #  Until a membership application is accepted, we just keep the
  #  company_number.  That's what we'll later use to create (instantiate)
  #  a company if/when needed.
