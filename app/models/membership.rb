  #   A 'first membership' is a membership for a user only if there are no past memberships within
  #     2 years
  #   If a user had a past membership within the previous _2 years_, then they are considered a
  #    "former member."  This may mean that there are different behaviours/actions/expectations.
  #    (Ex: a different welcome email might be sent out.)
