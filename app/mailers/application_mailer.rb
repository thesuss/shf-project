  # Formatting email is tricky because you cannot use the same CSS as you can in web pages,
  # and some email servers (like Google) will strip out a lot of stuff you would
  # typically put into the <head></head> section -- like references to stylesheets.
  # So you have to make sure that most things (styles, images, etc.) are *inline*
  # in the email html source.
  # This blog post is particularly helpful describing the issues and how to handle things:
