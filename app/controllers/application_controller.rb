  #  See that class for more details

  # Information sent:
  #
  #   * request_original_url: the full URL that is the source of the request
  #     ex:  https://hitta.sverigeshundforetagare.se/hundforetag/57
  #
  #   * request_method:  the HTTP method used for the request
  #     ex: GET or POST or PUT, etc.
  #
  #   * request_path: the portion of the URL specific to the SHF system;
  #     the +String+ full path including params of the last URL requested
  #     ex:  get "/articles?page=2"  will return
  #       "/articles?page=2"
  #
  #   * params_to_json: the parameters for the request, converted .to_json
  #
  #   * params_inspect: the String returned from params.inspect
  #     This will include the 'permitted' information, which is not included in the .to_json information
  #
  #   * current_user: so we know who was using the application when the error occured
  #
  #   * remote_addr: IP address to help identify bots and webcrawlers
  #
  #   * request_id: useful for tracking the request in logs
  #     from ActionDispatch::Request  def request_id :
  #       This unique ID is useful for tracing a request from end-to-end as part of
  #       logging or debugging.

  # When one of our URLS is cut and pasted in Facebook (FB), FB will actually
  # _change_ the URL.  Then anyone in FB clicking on the URL will be taken
  # to our system with a (possibly) invalid URL.
  # Ex:  I want to share the list of dog groomers in Skåne (a region) with someone.
  #   I do a search for all companies in Skäne with dog groomers.  I copy that resulting URL
  #   and share it with my friends in FB.  One of my friends clicks on it but
  #   because FB has mangled the URL, it no longer works and causes a 500 or 404 error.
  #
  # Specifically, FB may change  a value that should be an Array to a Hash.
  # It's pretty clear that FB is converting our params to JSON,
  # and then just serving that JSON right back to us without backing out the conversion.
  #
  # This method 'undoes' the changes that Facebook makes.
  # This is important for the Ransack gem, which we use for searching and sorting in some views.
