# Tasks to run to deploy the application.  Tasks defined here will be called by capistrano.

# If you are not familiar with Capistrano, you should read the documentation:
#   https://capistranorb.com/
#   https://github.com/capistrano/rails
#
# In addition, here are a few helpful links:
#   Good basic example of entire process using capistrano to deploy a Ruby on Rails application: https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-capistrano-to-deploy-a-rails-application-to-a-puma-server
#   Good write-up explaining some about capistrano: https://piotrmurach.com/articles/working-with-capistrano-tasks-roles-and-variables/

# Note: Many comments are commands/statements that can be run locally instead of on a remote server, e.g. when developing

# Map Markers
#  The map marker files are used to display markers on Google maps.
#
#  We require 6 (!) directories for the map markers:
#   public/map-markers,    ** this is the definitive directory
#   public/sv/map-markers,
#   public/sv/hundforetag/map-markers,
#   public/en/map-markers,
#   public/en/hundforetag/map-markers,
#   public/hundforetag/map-markers,
#
#  The 'source' (main) files are in the public/map-markers directory.
#
#  The application will create paths with the locale [sv|en] prepended, and then google-maps.js will
#  use those in the relative path that it constructs to get the map-marker image files (m*.png files).
#  The application creates the locale paths because of the locale filter gem (used in the routes.rb) file.
#  The root route (for non-logged in visitors) will look for the map markers in /public[/sv|en]/map-markers.
#  But often the path is specific to companies and so is /public[/sv|en]/hundforetag
#
#   (This all seems a bit too complex, but it's what is needed to get this working.)
#
#  The definitive directory is public/map-markers and it must have all of the map-marker files.
#  The other directories/files are just symbolic links too the definitive directory and files.
#
#  The definitive directory and files _must_ exist. A task checks to see if they do and fails if they don't.
#  The symbolic links are all created in another task.
