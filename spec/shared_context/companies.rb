# This will create these companies:
#
#  company_no_payments - a company with no payments
#  complete_co1 - has 2 branding payments
#  complete_co2 - just has a company name, number, and the company Factory defaults
#  co_no_viz_addresses - a company with just 1 address with visibility: none, and the company Factory defaults
#  company_3_addrs - has 3 addresses (via the Factory) and 2 events
#  co_with_short_h_brand_url - company with a short_h_brand_url, and company Factory defaults
#  co_no_name - name is an empty String, and company Factory defaults
#  co_nil_region - the region is set to nil, and company Factory defaults
#
# These can be used in tests by requiring this file,
#   and putting "include_context 'create companies'" in an example section or RSpec
#
