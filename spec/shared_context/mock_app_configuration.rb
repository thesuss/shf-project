# Mock for AdminOnly::AppConfiguration
# Mock for attachments, urls, and paths used with AppConfiguration
#
# Because AdminOnly::AppConfiguration is queried is nearly every test,
# there is value in mocking it and stubbing the methods to give us great
# speed-up in testing.
# Creating the AppConfiguration attachments is quite slow (relative to
# testing times). Multiply creating the attachments times each time an
# AppConfiguration is created for so many test and it's a lot of time.
# Thus using a mock (or mocks) speeds up testing considerably.
#
# See the before(:each) block in rails_helper.rb where this is used.
