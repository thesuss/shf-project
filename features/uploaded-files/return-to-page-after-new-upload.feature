Feature: A member is returned to their account page after uploading a file from that page

  As a member,
  if I am on my account page and want to upload a new file,
  after I successfully upload the new file,
  I should be taken back to my account page
  So that I can continue my work flow
  and so that I do not have to figure out how to manually get back to my account page.
