    # Note that you must go to the page _after_ the date has been set for this example so that the browser (via cucumber and Timecop) thinks the date it 2018-12-31.
    # Without the 'I am the page for company number "2120000142"' step explicitly in the scenario below, the date will 'be' "2018-01-01"
    # and it will be too early for a payment to be made, and a modal dialog box will come up with that info.
