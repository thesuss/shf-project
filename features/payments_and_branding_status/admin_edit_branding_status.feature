  Scenario: Admin edits branding status
    Given I am the page for company number "2120000142"
    Then I should see t("companies.show.hbrand_status_paid")
    And company number "2120000142" is paid through "2017-12-31"
    When I click on t("companies.show.edit_branding_status")
    Then I should see t("companies.show.edit_branding_status")
    And I should see t("activerecord.attributes.payment.expire_date")
    And I should see t("activerecord.attributes.payment.notes")
    When I select "2018" in select list "payment[expire_date(1i)]"
    And I select "juni" in select list "payment[expire_date(2i)]"
    And I select "1" in select list "payment[expire_date(3i)]"
    And I fill in t("activerecord.attributes.payment.notes") with "This is a note regarding this company."
    And I click on t("companies.company.submit_button_label")
    And I wait for all ajax requests to complete
    And I reload the page
    # ^^ should not have to do this - check later after upgrades
    Then company number "2120000142" is paid through "2018-06-01"
    And I should see "This is a note regarding this company."
