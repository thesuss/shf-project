Feature: Admin sees as many or few SHF Applications as they want (pagination)

  As an admin,
  so that I can manage membership applications,
  I want to see all membership applications

  @selenium
  Scenario: Pagination: default is All, can set to just 10 items
    Given I am logged in as "admin@shf.se"
    And I am on the "membership applications" page
    And I hide the membership applications search form
    Then "items_count" should have "All" selected
    And I select "10" in select list "items_count"
    Then "items_count" should have "10" selected
    # prevents getting the element not clickable at that position error in Chrome

    And I scroll so the top of the list of companies is visible
    When I click on t("shf_applications.index.org_nr")

    And I should see "6222279082" before "6613265393"
    And I should see "6613265393" before "6914762726"

    # Capybara seems to be viewing the search form select lists (options) as 'visible',
    #  so it pics those up with the simple "And I should see ..." steps.
    # I am ensuring that we are checking in the actual list of shf applications
    # (search select options are not within the div#shf_applications_list, so they'll be ignored)
    And I should see "6222279082" in the list of applications
    And I should see "6613265393" in the list of applications

    And I should see "8728875504" in the list of applications
    And I should not see "6914762726" in the list of applications
    And I should not see "8764985894" in the list of applications
