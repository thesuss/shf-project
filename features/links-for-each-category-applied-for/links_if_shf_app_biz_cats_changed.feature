Feature: Applicant sees links and gets email about additional questions if business categories are changed

  If an applicant edits their application and adds or removes the business categories for it
  then the applicatn should see a (flash) message about the additional questions for any business categories added
  and they should get an email with the additional question links, too.

  The admin does not get any email because the business categories can only be changed if it is not under review or accepted or rejected


  Background:
    Given the Membership Ethical Guidelines Master Checklist exists
    And the application file upload options exist

    Given the following users exist:
      | email                 | admin | first_name | last_name |

    And the following business categories exist
      | name         | apply_qs_url                |
      | Groomer      | https://example.com/groomer |
      | Psychologist | https://example.com/psych   |
      | Trim         | https://example.com/trim    |
      | Butik        | https://example.com/butik   |
      | Blorf        | https://example.com/blorf   |

    And the following companies exist:
      | name                 | company_number | email                  | region    |
      | No More Snarky Barky | 5560360793     | snarky@snarkybarky.com | Stockholm |

    And the following applications exist:
      | user_email            | company_number | state | categories            | uploaded file names |
      | applicant@example.com | 5560360793     | new   | Groomer, Psychologist | diploma.pdf         |


    And I am logged in as "applicant@example.com"
