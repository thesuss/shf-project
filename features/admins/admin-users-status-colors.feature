Feature: Membership status is color-coded for admin's list of all users

  As an admin
  So that I can quickly see the status of users,
  Color-code and otherwise style the membership status
  On the 'all users' page


  Background:
    Given the App Configuration is not mocked and is seeded
    Given the Membership Ethical Guidelines Master Checklist exists
    And the grace period is 0 years, 0 months, and 600 days

    Given the following users exist:
      | email                         | admin | membership_status | membership_number | member |
      | current-member@example.com    |       | current_member    | 100               | true   |

    And I am logged in as "admin@shf.se"
    And the date is set to "2021-06-06"

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario: Legend is shown at the top
    Given I am on the "all users" page
    Then I should see css class "legend" 1 times


  @selenium
  Scenario: The membership status is used as the CSS class for each user's membership status and last day (if there is a last day)
    Given I am on the "all users" page
    When I select "All" in select list "items_count"
    And I wait for all ajax requests to complete
    Then I should see 16 users

    And css class "current-member" should appear 2 times in the users table
    And css class "expires-soon" should appear 4 times in the users table
    And css class "in-grace-period" should appear 6 times in the users table
    And css class "former-member" should appear 8 times in the users table

    # Note there is no last day for those that are not-a-member, so the css style only applies to the membership_status (once per user)
    And css class "not-a-member" should appear 6 times in the users table
