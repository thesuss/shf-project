Feature: Companies are listed in order of date last updated

  So that companies other than the first ones added get to be seen at the top of the list of all companies
  Because people usually don't scroll down to see other companies
  Don't put the companies in order by database id ( = order they were added to the db),

  Default to ordering them by date last updated (most recent = first)
  to encourage the company members to come to the SHF site and update information about their company.
