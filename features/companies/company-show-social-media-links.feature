    Given the date is set to "2019-10-10"

  Scenario: Company has all social media urls; all social media icons are shown
    Given I am logged in as "member@all-social-media.com"
    And I am on the page for company number "2120000142"
    Then I should see an icon with CSS class "fa-facebook" that is linked to "https://facebook.com/example"
    And I should see an icon with CSS class "fa-youtube" that is linked to "https://youtube.com/mychannel"
    And I should see an icon with CSS class "fa-instagram" that is linked to "https://instagram.com/example"

  Scenario: Company only has Instagram; only that icon is shown
    Given I am logged in as "member@only-instagram.com"
    And I am on the page for company number "5560360793"
    Then I should not see an icon with CSS class "fa-facebook"
    And I should not see an icon with CSS class "fa-youtube"
    And I should see an icon with CSS class "fa-instagram" that is linked to "https://instagram.com/only-instagram"

  Scenario: Company has no social media urls; no social media icons are shown
    Given I am logged in as "member@no-social-media.com"
    And I am on the page for company number "7661057765"
