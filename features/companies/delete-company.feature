Feature: Admin deletes a company

  As an admin
  In order to keep the list of companies valid and up to date
  I need to be able to delete companies

  PT: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/138063171

  Only delete a company if it is not associated with any ShfApplications,
  other than applications with status == :being_destroyed.

  Only delete the business categories associated with a company
  if those business categories are not associated with any other companies.
  (Holds for each business category independently. So some might be deleted,
  and some might not.)
