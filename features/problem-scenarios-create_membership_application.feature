Feature: Create a new membership application [CI PROBLEM SCENARIOS]

  2020-09-10:
  These scenarios have problems: they often fail on  (CI) Semaphore.
  Problems seem to be the timing of the DOM refresh/changes and the
  different processes  used (e.g. capybara, rails).

  We know these scenarios work in real life, but we still need to have
  these scenarios working so that we are sure that they continue to
  work and so that any other changes do not cause problems with them.


  As a user
  In order to get a membership with SHF (which makes my business more valuable )
  I need to be able to submit a Membership Application
  And as part of the process of creating an application,
  I need to either specify an existing company number for my company, or,
  If that is not available, I need to create a new company

  Secondary feature:
  As an admin
  So that we can minimize trouble signing up and sign up as many users as possible
  I would like required aspects of the membership form to be highlighted when they are missed
