Feature: As an admin
  So that I can view and manage companies
  I need to be able to create them

  Companies are created when a membership application is approved. That
  will not have any user interaction, but we need to have companies
  exist and the admin needs to be able to see the list of them.

  This feature exercises what happens when a company is created and is the
  basis for a member being able to edit their company page.
