Feature: As a visitor,
  So that I can see if a company can provide the services I need,
  Show me the details about a company

  Because some Org Nr.s are actually for individuals and we don't have a reliable
  way to tell if they are or not, and because we do not want to
  (and legally cannot) show the org nr. for an individual,
  only show the Org Nr to admins.
