  Scenario: New application - Uploads a file that is too large
    Given I am logged in as "hans@new_applicant.se"
    And I am on the "submit new membership application" page
    When I fill in the translated form with data:
      | shf_applications.new.first_name | shf_applications.new.last_name | shf_applications.new.company_number | shf_applications.new.phone_number | shf_applications.new.contact_email |
