Feature: Applicant gets an email when the application is approved

  As an applicant,
  So that I know that SHF has approved the application (still need to pay)
  and so I know what I should expect to happen next,
  I should get an email letting me know the application was approved and now I need to pay
  And I should see a link to my account in the email so I can pay

      | email              | admin |
      | emma@happymutts.se |       |

    And the following business categories exist
      | name    |

  Scenario: Admin approves membership and email is sent to applicant
    Given I am logged in as "admin@shf.com"
    And I am on the "application" page for "emma@happymutts.se"
    When I click on t("shf_applications.accept_btn")
    And I should be on the "edit application" page for "emma@happymutts.se"
    And I should see t("shf_applications.accept.success")
    And I click on t("shf_applications.edit.submit_button_label")

    And I should see t("shf_applications.update.success_with_app_files_missing")

    And I should see t("shf_applications.accepted")
    Then "emma@happymutts.se" should receive an email
    And I am logged in as "emma@happymutts.se"
    And I open the email
    And I should see t("mailers.shf_application_mailer.app_approved.subject") in the email subject
    # must make sure this is not the edit page; it would also match the pattern for the show user page
    And I should not see "http://localhost:3000/anvandare/1/redigera" in the email body
    And I should see "http://localhost:3000/anvandare/1" in the email body
    And I should see ""Sveriges Hundföretagare" <info@sverigeshundforetagare.se>" in the email "from" header
    And I should see ""Sveriges Hundföretagare" <medlem@sverigeshundforetagare.se>" in the email "reply-to" header
    When I follow "http://localhost:3000/anvandare/1" in the email
    Then I should see "Firstname Lastname"
    And I should see t("users.show.email")
    And I should see t("application")
    And I should not see t("users.show.membership_number")
