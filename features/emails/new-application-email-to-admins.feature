Feature: When a new application is received, all admins get an email notification

  As an admin,
  So that I know that SHF received a new application and that we need to start reviewing it,
  I should get an email with a link to the application so I can go look at it
  and the email of the applicant so I have it if there is some problem with the application or the SHF system
  I can contact the applicant easily.


  Background:
    Given the Membership Ethical Guidelines Master Checklist exists

    Given the following users exist:
      | email               | admin | first_name | last_name  |
      | admin1@shf.se       | yes   |            |            |
      | admin2@shf.se       | yes   |            |            |
      | admin3@shf.se       | yes   |            |            |
      | emma@happymutts.com |       | Emma       | HappyMutts |


    And the following business categories exist
      | name         |
