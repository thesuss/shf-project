Feature: Applicant gets an email when membership has been granted. (They are now a member).

  As an applicant,
  So that I am notified that I am now a member
  and so I know what I should expect to happen next,
  I should get an email telling me I'm a member and explaining what I need to do next
  And the email should include a link to my company page
  So that I can pay the branding fee (if needed) and then perhaps edit my company information
