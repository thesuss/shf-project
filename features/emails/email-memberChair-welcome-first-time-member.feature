Feature: Membership chair gets an email when a first-time-ever membership has been granted.

  As the membership chair,
  So that I can welcome a new member on social media, send a membership package, etc.,
  I should get an email when someone has been granted membership for the first time
  and they have joined a Company (and the company is in good standing).
