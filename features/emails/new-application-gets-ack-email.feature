  As a new applicant,
  So that I know that SHF received my application and that I didn't do something wrong,
  and so I know what I should expect to happen next,
  I should get an email acknowledging my new application

    And I should see t("mailers.shf_application_mailer.acknowledge_received.message_text") in the email body
