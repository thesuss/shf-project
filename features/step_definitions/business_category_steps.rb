  # You must use a driver that supports javascript if using this step.

  # 5/27/2018 - we are using "collection_check_boxes" helper in the appication
  # form.  This sets a hidden field that ensures that business_categories (for
  # the membership application) is updated even if no categories are checked in
  # the form (see "Gotcha" in documentation for that method).
  # However, this hidden field has the same name as all of the checkboxes in the
  # collection.  As a result, all tested JS-capable drivers (Chrome, Selenium,
  # Poltergeist) fail to find the checkbox unless we set "visible" to either
  # :false or :any.
  # Also the capybara method for checking a checkbox ("page.check(element)")
  # fails becuase it first executes a "find" for the element and that fails
  # for the same reason (and there no way to override this).
  # Hence the need to execute some JS to check the checkbox.

  # 2019-01-28 AE:  If your test doesn't really care _which_ category you need to pick
  # then just choose the first one.  The id of each category checkbox is
  #  shf_application_business_category_ids_<number>
  # So you can actually check/uncheck specific categories if you know the
  # number (e.g. the n-th one).
  # You can then just use this step to check (select) a category:
  #    And I check the checkbox with id "shf_application_business_category_ids_1"
  # or this one to unselect:
  #    And I uncheck the checkbox with id "shf_application_business_category_ids_1"
