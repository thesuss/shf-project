    And I fill in the translated form with data:

      | doc 1                   | description 1                 |
    And I choose a shf-document named "diploma.pdf" to upload
    And I click on t("submit") button
    Given I am on the "new SHF document" page
    And I fill in the translated form with data:
      | shf_documents.new.title | shf_documents.new.description |
      | doc 2                   | description 2                 |

    And I choose a shf-document named "image.png" to upload
    And I click on t("submit") button
    And I am on the "all shf documents" page
    And I should see 3 shf-documents listed
    And I should see t("delete")
    When I click and accept the t("delete") action for the row with "doc 1"
    Then I should see t("shf_documents.destroy.success", document_title: "doc 1")
    And I should see 2 shf-documents listed
    And I should not see "description 1"
