    Given I am logged in as "admin@shf.se"


  Scenario: Admin can set date range for the recent summary numbers


  Scenario: default date range for summary is the past 30 days


  @selenium_browser
  Scenario: Admin sees total membership counts and counts for last 30 days
    Given I am on the "admin dashboard" page
    Then I should see "ADMIN DASHBOARD"
    And I should see "11 members"
    And I should see "12 successful payments in the past 7 days"
    And I should see "11 member fee payments"
    And I should see "1 branding fee payments"
    And I should see "0 Applications approved but no membership payment yet"
    And I should see "1 companies Branding license fee not yet paid"
    And I should see "0 companies with nformation not yet complete"

   # And I should see "3 new applications"

   # And I should see "1 waiting for information from the applicant"
   # And I should see "4 under review"
   # And I should see "2 ready for review again"
   # And I should see "1 rejection"


#  Scenario: If there are no applications for a state, then a zero (0) is displayed instead of skipping it
