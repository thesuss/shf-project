Feature: Admin can search on everything and save results

  As an admin
  So that I can explore and understand the information in the system
  I need to be able to search on everything, including combinations of everything
  And so that I can share the information I find
  I need to be able to export the results as CSV or Text)

  I do not want to have to go to separate pages (e.g. 'users,' 'membership applications, etc')
  and then manually put together the info.
  Let me search on different combinations.

  I would really like to be able to save searches so I can run them again.
