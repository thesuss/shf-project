Feature: Admin edits membership status, dates, notes (membership info)

  As an admin
  I need to be able to change the membership status

  @selenium @time_adjust
  Scenario: Admin edits membership last day and note
    Given I am on the "user details" page for "emma@mutts.com"
    Then the last day of membership for "emma@mutts.com" should be 2017-12-31
    When I click on t("users.user.edit_member_status")
    Then I should see t("users.user.edit_member_status")
    And I should see t("users.show.member")
    And I should see t("activerecord.attributes.membership.last_day")
    And I should see t("activerecord.attributes.membership.notes")
    When I select "2018" in select list "membership[last_day(1i)]"
    And I select "juni" in select list "membership[last_day(2i)]"
    And I select "1" in select list "membership[last_day(3i)]"
    And I fill in t("activerecord.attributes.membership.notes") with "Extended their membership to 1 juni 2018."
    And I click on t("users.user.submit_button_label")
    And I wait for all ajax requests to complete
    And I reload the page
    # ^^ should not have to do this - check later after upgrades. (DOM/page partial _is_ updated in real life, but not with capybara)
    Then I should see "Extended their membership to 1 juni 2018."
    And the last day of membership for "emma@mutts.com" should be 2018-06-01


  @selenium
  Scenario: Admin changes the last day and it is before today so the member is no longer a member
    Given the date is set to "2017-11-01"
    And I am on the "user details" page for "emma@mutts.com"
    Then the last day of membership for "emma@mutts.com" should be 2017-12-31
    And "emma@mutts.com" should be a member
    When I click on t("users.user.edit_member_status")

    And I wait for all ajax requests to complete
    And I reload the page
    # ^^ should not have to do this - check later after upgrades. (DOM/page partial _is_ updated in real life, but not with capybara)
    Then the last day of membership for "emma@mutts.com" should be 2017-09-01
    And "emma@mutts.com" should not be a member


  @selenium
  Scenario: Admin changes lastday for user in grace period (not a member) to a member
    Given I am on the "user details" page for "grace-member@mutts.com"
    Then "grace-member@mutts.com" should be in the grace period
    And the last day of membership for "grace-member@mutts.com" should be 2017-10-31
    When I click on t("users.user.edit_member_status")

    And I should see t("users.show.is_a_member")
    And "grace-member@mutts.com" should be a member


#  @selenium
