Feature: Admin enables/disables the emails sent when a new application is received

  As an admin
  I want to be able to turn off (disable) emails that are sent out to the admin when a new application is received
  And I want to be able to turn them on (enable) them so they are sent.


  Background:

    Given the Membership Ethical Guidelines Master Checklist exists

    Given the following users exist:
      | email                 | admin | member |
      | new_user1@example.com |       |        |
      | admin@shf.se          | true  |        |

    And the following business categories exist
      | name    |
      | Groomer |

    And the application file upload options exist

    And the following companies exist:
      | name                 | company_number | email                  | region     |
      | No More Snarky Barky | 5560360793     | snarky@snarkybarky.com | Stockholm  |

    And the App Configuration is not mocked and is seeded
