Feature: Admin edits application configuration
  As an admin
  I want to be able to edit application configuration
  including images for the site meta image, chair signature, SHF logo images, and company h-brand;
  site name, and meta information: title, keywords, and description.


  Background:
    Given the Membership Ethical Guidelines Master Checklist exists

    Given the following users exist:
      | email             | password | admin | member    | first_name | last_name |
      | admin@random.com  | password | true  | false     | emma       | admin     |

    And the App Configuration is not mocked and is seeded

    And I am logged in as "admin@random.com"
    And I am on the "admin edit app configuration" page
