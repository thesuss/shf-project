Feature: Admin manages the list of reasons why SHF is waiting for info from an applicant

  As an Admin
  So that I can keep the list of reasons meaningful and usable to SHF Admins looking at membership applications
  I need to be able to add, edit, and delete the list of reasons why SHF is waiting for info from an applicant,
  including reviewing 'custom' (other) reasons that were entered by Admins and determining if they need to be
  permanently added to the list of reasons or removed from the list.
