Feature: "Other/Custom" waiting reason comes from locale file and Admin cannot edit or delete it

  As an Admin
  Because the "Other/custom" reason needs to always exist so that the UI (e.g. view) can use it to display a custom text field if it's chosen,
  And because the text displayed must be always translated,
  The text displayed for "Other/custom" reason must always come from a locale file

  This requires a different background set-up than the "admin-manage-reasons..." feature.
  This requires that the system be seeded *before* any other information is entered (via other background statements).


  Background:

    # it is important that this statement is first so that tables are empty, so that things will be seeded
    # Given the system is seeded with initial data

    And I am logged in as "admin@shf.se"


  @admin @selenium
  Scenario: The "other/custom" reason is listed as a reason for the 'waiting for...' status
    Given I am on the "application" page for "anna_waiting_for_info@nosnarkybarky.se"
    Then "member_app_waiting_reasons" should have t("admin_only.member_app_waiting_reasons.other_custom_reason") as an option

  @admin @selenium
  Scenario: "other/custom" reason is listed when the state is changed TO 'waiting for applicant'
    Given I am on the "application" page for "anna_under_review@nosnarkybarky.se"
    When I click on t("shf_applications.ask_applicant_for_info_btn")
    Then "member_app_waiting_reasons" should have t("admin_only.member_app_waiting_reasons.other_custom_reason") as an option

  @admin @selenium
  Scenario: "other/custom" reason is listed when the language is changed
    Given I am on the "application" page for "anna_waiting_for_info@nosnarkybarky.se"
    Then "member_app_waiting_reasons" should have t("admin_only.member_app_waiting_reasons.other_custom_reason") as an option


  @admin @selenium
  Scenario: The "other/custom" reason doesn't appear in the list of all reasons
    Given I am on the "all waiting for info reasons" page
    Then I should see 2 reasons listed
    And I should not see t("admin_only.member_app_waiting_reasons.other_custom_reason")
