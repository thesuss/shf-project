Feature: Admin sets or enters the reason they are waiting for info from a user
  As an admin
  so that SHF can talk with the user specifically about why they are waiting and know how long they might need to wait,
  I need to set the reason why SHF is waiting
  and if the reason is not available from a list,
  I need to be able to type in text that describes the situation

  @javascript @admin
  Scenario: Admin selects 'need more documentation' as the reason SHF is waiting_for_applicant
    Given I am on "AnnaWaiting" application page
    When I set "member_app_waiting_reasons" to "need doc"
    Then "member_app_waiting_reasons" should have "need doc" selected
    And I am on the list applications page
    And I am on "AnnaWaiting" application page
    Then "member_app_waiting_reasons" should have "need doc" selected

    And the t("membership_applications.need_info.other_reason_label") field should be set to "This is my reason"
    And "member_app_waiting_reasons" should have t("admin_only.member_app_waiting_reasons.other_custom_reason") selected


  @javascript @admin
  Scenario: Admin selects 'other' and fills in custom text but then changes reason to something else
    Given I am on "AnnaWaiting" application page

    And I set "member_app_waiting_reasons" to t("admin_only.member_app_waiting_reasons.other_custom_reason")
    And I wait for all ajax requests to complete
    Then I should not see "This is my reason"
