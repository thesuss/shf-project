Feature: Admin sets or enters the reason they are waiting for info from a user
  As an admin
  so that SHF can talk with the user specifically about why they are waiting and know how long they might need to wait,
  I need to set the reason why SHF is waiting
  and if the reason is not available from a list,
  I need to be able to type in text that describes the situation
