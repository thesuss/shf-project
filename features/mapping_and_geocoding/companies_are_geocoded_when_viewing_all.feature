  Scenario: A company that isn't geocoded is geocoded before all are viewed
    Given all addresses for the company named "No More Snarky Barky" are not geocoded
    And all addresses for the company named "Bowsers" are not geocoded
    And all addresses for the company named "CompanyNotVisible" are not geocoded
    And I am Logged out
    When I am on the "landing" page
    Then all addresses for the company named "No More Snarky Barky" should be geocoded
    And all addresses for the company named "Bowsers" should be geocoded
    And all addresses for the company named "CompanyNotVisible" should not be geocoded
    And I should see "No More Snarky Barky"
    And I should see "Bowsers"
    And I should see "CompanyNotVisible"
