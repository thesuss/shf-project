Feature: Applicant home (account) page - version 1.0

  As a user that has applied or will apply,
  my account page needs provide me with the clear ways to complete each step needed for membership:
  1. fill out my application,
  2. agree to the ethical guidelines,
  3. pay my membership fee.


  Background:

    Given the Membership Ethical Guidelines Master Checklist exists
    And the application file upload options exist

    # Default is that the Ethical guidelines are required.
    # Some scenarios below test for when they are NOT required.
    And the date is set to "2020-03-01"
