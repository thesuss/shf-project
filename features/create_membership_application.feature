Feature: Create a new membership application

  2020-09-10:  Note that 2 scenarios have been removed from this feature file
    and put into 'problem-scenarios-create_membership_application.feature'.
    They have been causing intermittent failures during CI Semaphore tests.
    See the note in that file for more info.

  As a user
  In order to get a membership with SHF (which makes my business more valuable )
  I need to be able to submit a Membership Application
  And as part of the process of creating an application,
  I need to either specify an existing company number for my company, or,
  If that is not available, I need to create a new company

  &: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135027425

  Secondary feature:
  As an admin
  So that we can minimize trouble signing up and sign up as many users as possible
  I would like required aspects of the membership form to be highlighted when they are missed
